## Generate-Passwords
I developed this application as a side project to explore and learn about new modules, GUI, and other exciting features.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Consouldenature/Generate-Passwords.git

i) main.py is the main code file used for the application.
ii) logo.png is the background image used in this app.

## What the App Does:
i) The app prompts you to provide a website, email, and password.
ii) When all fields are filled, it creates or updates a data.txt file that stores all the input values.
iii) Clicking the "Generate Password" button generates a password and automatically copies it to your clipboard.

'If you are using Windows 11/Visual Studio Code like me, you need to open the terminal and run the following commands:'
i) python -m venv myenv
ii) myenv/Scripts/activate
iii) pip install pyperclip
Now you are ready to run the code.

# If all fields are provided, a popup will appear, asking if you want to continue:

# After clicking 'Ok,' the values will be saved in data.txt, and all values in the 'Password Manager' will be cleared:
